Tracks with multiple matches

The original files for the following tracks were not found in their expected locations, but multiple files with the same name were found elsewhere:

No Artist - No Album - 'SINEWAVE'
Old:
{testLibraryDirectory}/PioneerDJ/Sampler/OSC_SAMPLER/PRESET ONESHOT/SINEWAVE.wav

Tracks with missing files

The files for the following tracks couldn't be found anywhere in the specified search directory:

No Artist - No Album - 'NOISE'
Missing: {testLibraryDirectory}/PioneerDJ/Sampler/OSC_SAMPLER/PRESET ONESHOT/NOISE.wav

No Artist - No Album - 'SoundCloud Plugin Track'
Missing: /soundcloud:tracks:1149223021



Tracks with invalid locations

The following tracks couldn't be analysed or repaired because the file locations specified in the rekordbox XML library file were in some way invalid, e.g. contained a raw question mark.  For these files the fix is to remove them from your rekordbox collection then re-import them:

No Artist - No Album - 'Question Mark Track'
Invalid: file://localhost/Name%20with%20?.mp3



Tracks with path too long

rekordbox has a limit of 255 characters for the full path to a track's file, e.g. "/Users/User/Music/Library/Artist/Album/Music File.mp3" is 53 characters long.  The following files exceed that limit and therefore can't be imported to rekordbox:

{testLibraryDirectory}/File with a really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really long name.mp3


Tracks on disk but not in rekordbox

The following files exist in the specified search directory but haven't yet been imported into rekordbox:

{testLibraryDirectory}/File with a really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really long name.mp3
{testLibraryDirectory}/Not in rekordbox/Not in rekordbox.mp3

Tracks with missing files

The files for the following tracks couldn't be found anywhere in the specified search directory:

Tracks with invalid locations

The following tracks couldn't be analysed or repaired because the file locations specified in the rekordbox XML library file were in some way invalid, e.g. contained a raw question mark.  For these files the fix is to remove them from your rekordbox collection then re-import them:

{tracks-invalid-path}


Tracks with path too long

rekordbox has a limit of 255 characters for the full path to a track's file, e.g. "/Users/User/Music/Library/Artist/Album/Music File.mp3" is 53 characters long.  The following files exceed that limit and therefore can't be imported to rekordbox:

{tracks-path-too-long}


Tracks on disk but not in rekordbox

The following files exist in the specified search directory but haven't yet been imported into rekordbox:

{tracks-not-in-rekordbox}
